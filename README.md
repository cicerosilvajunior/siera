What is EDM Tool?
-----------

This tool aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using data mining techniques and performance analysis to support the identification of students at risk of evasion or with the need to reinforce learning.

EDM Tool uses some classification algorithms implemented at Weka machine learning workbench to classify students at risk of evasion and BKT Brute Force algorithm from Baker, Corbett, and Aleven (2008) to identify the need to reinforce learning for a specific student.
